## React Module Project - FakeStoreApp Project Overview

In this project, a FakeStore E-Commerce App will be built using React, React Router, and FakeStoreAPI. This app will allow users to view, create, update, and delete products dynamically using API calls. This project reinforces state management, API interactions, React Router for navigation, and component-based architecture.

Important Note: FakeStoreAPI is a mock API designed for testing and learning purposes. While it will respond positively to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests (as if the actions were successful), these changes will not actually persist. You’ll still receive a success message and can test how your app handles these interactions, but the data will reset or remain unchanged when you fetch it again.

A backend will not have to be developed. This app will interact with the FakeStoreApp external API solely for practice with front-end API integration.
